Matado (1.0)
----------------------------------
This game is similar to Hangman, but instead of guessing the player needs to complete the words shown in a figure. It was developed when my oldest daughter started school as a way to help her to learn writing while having some fun.

The game owes it's name to one of those beautiful mistakes made by kids when they start talking. She said to me 'Dad, look, I'm Matada' ('Matada' stands for 'Muerta' which means 'Dead' in english) playing as if she was dead, turing that 'MATADO0 term in a daily & common word in our family.
